# Color Game

This is a simple color guessing game where the player has to select the color that matches a target color from a set of options. The game keeps track of the player's score, and it generates random color options for each round.

## Features

- A color is selected as the target color for each round.
- The player must choose the correct color from a set of 6 randomly generated color options.
- The game keeps track of the score.
- The game stores the state (including the score and the target color) using session storage, so it persists between page reloads.
- The game provides feedback to the player after each guess, letting them know if their guess was correct or incorrect.
